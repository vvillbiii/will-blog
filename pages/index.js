            Hi, my name is Will. <br />I am a Software Engineer in New York
            City.

            I worked in SEO, and digital marketing before becoming a software
            engineer. Finding new ways to solve problems and learning new skills
            are interests of mine. In addition to solving problems
            independently, I value collaboration because there is more than one
            way to achieve an answer, and everyoneâ€™s input is valuable. My
            strengths are my attention to detail and my ability to meet
            deadlines.
