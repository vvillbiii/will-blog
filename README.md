# Will Blog

This is my personal blog.

I used Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Contentful for this project.

The styling is simple. I care more about the words on the page than the desgin of the site, because it's main purpose is show my writing, nothing else.

I implemented a light and dark mode feature. That's the only stretch feature on this project.
